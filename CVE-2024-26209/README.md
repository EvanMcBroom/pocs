# CVE-2024-26209

Microsoft Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) information disclosure vulnerability.

### Notes

The `negotiate` SSP allows users to submit protocol messages to it using the `LsaCallAuthenticationPackage` API. The SSP supports the undocumented `NegEnumPackagePrefixes` message which allows users outside of LSASS to request a buffer of data from `negotiate`. The buffer is not null'd out before being used and is only partially filled with data before being returned to the user. The user may use the command to leak data from LSASS's process memory.
